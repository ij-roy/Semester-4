Its normalizing genitalia mutilation. Which also harms women because it being normalized means people start thinking its okay to do to women. Which its not. Because it can have a major effect on a womans life. Up to and including them not being able to have pleasure during sex.   So yes i do think circumsion (aka male genitalia mutilation) does have a negative impact on women.   I also think that circumsion its self needs to be reevaluated.

That idea is kept alive and current by the following mechanism:  It is ~~illegal~~ ~~immoral~~ against the rules for a man to say that he *does not* find a woman attractive.  In nearly any circumstance,  a man stating that he does not find a particular woman attractive will be interpreted to mean that he hates all women or he is gay.  Women can freely talk about their attraction to particular men and their lack of attraction to others.  Women are free to say that any particular man,  or any group of men,  or even *all* men are unattractive,  men are not free to make such distinctions.  Therefor all men must at times, on some level be prepared to publicly claim that they *are* irresistibly drawn to each and every woman in the world.

Joint custody happens in 97% of the cases of married couples, but it's also 94% of the cases in the US, or 88% for unmarried couples in Sweden, and I can't find the statistics for the same in the US. So the vast majority of the cases, the parents are adult enough to actually be able to work together for the best of the children, regardless if it's Sweden or the US, though Sweden is somewhat better it seems at making joint custody work. But looking at just the cases where they for whatever reason can't do that, the outlook is grim indeed, because it's less than half a percent where the father has sole custody... less than HALF A FUCKING PERCENT, where in the US, it's about 4%. So US is, as abysmally bad as it is, still actually more fair on who gets sole custody, than Sweden is.", "target": "You can't fight the reddit 'Scandinavian countries do everything better' circle jerk.", "ID": 2057}

Rereading it now, I'm realizing a bit how absurd that mindset is.   Men should be allowed to decide if they want a child during the first trimester. This would legally bind them to supporting the child if they said they wanted it. If they say they don't want it, it still allows the woman to have the child or not have the child, simply with the knowledge that they will be a single parent. I think that remains reasonably fair, despite the fact that it will not allow men to have a kid the woman wants to abort. I think it would be unreasonable for a woman to be forced to take a child to term they did not want to. ", "ID": 4063}

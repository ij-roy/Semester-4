Circumsion is literally male genitalia mutilation. You are literally lopping off a part of a mans penis when you circumsize him. Now it may not have any major effect on their life. But its true. Its normalizing genitalia mutilation. Which also harms women because it being normalized means people start thinking its okay to do to women. Which its not. Because it can have a major effect on a womans life. Up to and including them not being able to have pleasure during sex.   So yes i do think circumsion (aka male genitalia mutilation) does have a negative impact on women.   I also think that circumsion its self needs to be reevaluated.

{"context": "Makes sense but you're attacking a straw man.   Sexual objectification is treating someone as a mere object of pleasure.   It refers to men that only think of women as pussy but otherwise vapid children. Wealth rose. Women didn't need to work. They weren't valued for anything else. The history of women's value is a rollercoaster, very interesting. Anyway for awhile it was iconic masculinity, agree?  It was unchallenged in songs, advertisement, all expressions. But women started challenging it. A lot of men listened. Fewer and fewer men feel this way, but the denial of the intellectual value of women didn't disappear overnight.  These assholes lurk everywhere, and it's very hard to challenge them when they're older or powerful. Sometimes it's status quo. Sometimes it's dismissed as a quirk.   I know I said straw man earlier, but there are indeed some freaky people that think all sex is violence, far out shit. All groups have people that push it too far, right?
